# This is going to be a Prediction Project


Project Structure:


This project is organized mostly within a "Source" directory (src) where all the project code and components are placed.

### Components directory
The components directory as the name suggests, hosts all the main components of the project and its of the file names indicates their purpose.

### Pipelines directory
This is where different data processing pipelines are defined.
1. train_pipeline.py: This script likely defines the data processing pipeline for model training. It may orchestrate the sequence of data ingestion, transformation, training, and evaluation.

2. predict_pipeline.py: This script appears to define a data processing pipeline for making predictions using a trained model.

a. logger.py: This module is responsible for handling project logging. It sets up a logging configuration, allowing various messages to be logged, including errors and information about the project's execution.

b. exception.py: This module defines a custom exception class and error handling functions. It's intended to capture and handle exceptions that may occur during the project's execution.

c. utils.py: This utility module contains common functions that are meant to be used throughout the project. It could include functions for interacting with databases, cloud storage, or other common tasks.
